## 📦 Docker Compose Library
This is  Collection of my docker compose files for my various projects and services

###  📂 Structure
Each folder contains a docker-compose.yml file and optional .env file for environment variables.
Copy the yml files from the repo of your choice and follow the instructions found in the ReadMe associated to it.
Here is the general file structure
